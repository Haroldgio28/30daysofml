# 30 Days Of Machine Learning-Kaggle

This is a repo where I write my learning process of Machine Learning. 

## Lessons Learned

### Python course
During the first course of Python, I could review some topics that I learned in the past:

- Functions
- Booleans and conditionals
- Lists
- Loops
- List Comprenhensions (in some cases, understand this topic for me is difficult)
- String and Dictionaries
- External libraries

I must work in the blackjack (blackjack.py) program.

### Introduction to Machine Learning
This course was very exciting for me because it was my first time that I learned Machine Learning.

Below, some concepts reviewed on the course:

- Data Exploration with Pandas
- Building a ML model:
    - Data selection for model
    - Drop missing values
    - Select prediction object
    - Features selection for model
- Scikit-Learn library:
    - Decision Tree Regressor
    - Random Forest Regressor
- Model Validation:
    - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
    - Underfitting
    - Overfitting

### Intermediate Machine Learning
This course have been very challenging because issues are getting deeper.

Topics viewed:
- Handle missing values:
    - Drop missing values
    - Imputation
    - Extension to Imputation
- Categoric Variables:
    - Drop categoric Variables
    - Ordinal encoding
    - One-hot encoding
